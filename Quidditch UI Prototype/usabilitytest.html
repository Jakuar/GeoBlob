<h1>Task 3: Quick Usability Check</h1>
<p>My first usability test had several findings.</p>
<ul>
<li>The participant did not know how many people are supposed to be in the team when on the player selection page.</li>
<li>They were very efficient at filling out the team creation form.</li> 
<li>They hesitated a bit on the player selection page which is most likely due to the number of options on the page (Hick-Hyman law) and lack of grouping.</li>
</ul>
<p>User feedback</p>
<ul>
<li>The participant wanted to have wins and losses in the player invites and player search tables table rather than just the in their profile page.</li>
<li>They thought that the interface was intuitive and easy to understand.</li>
<li>They thought that the confirm and cancel button was hard to find on the player selection page.</li>
</ul>
<p>Changes</p>
<ul>
<li>Added tips for the player selection page to direct the user at the task required to be completed. These tips are the first section on the page, so they will be visible to user.</li>
<li>Placed the confirm and quit buttons underneath player selection tips so they are easily visible.</li>
<li>Added how many people should be recruited into a team under the selected players heading.</li>
<li>Grouped player selection options more clearly with hairlines.</li>
<li>I decided not to implement the wins and loses information in the tables as sorting players by their performance does not seem to be a goal of a casual quidditch player.</li>
</ul> 
<p>Second usability test findings after changes and using the same participant</p>
<ul>
<li>Participant performed slightly better compared to the first test.</li>
<li>They were able to find the confirm button and newly added guidelines easily.</li>
<li>They understood how many players should be in the team.</li>
</ul>
